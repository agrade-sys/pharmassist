analyze_trial_sites_task:
  description: >
    Analyze Phase IIb trial data from all 8 sites. Identify:
    1. Enrollment status (current 740/788 = 93.9% - is this sufficient?)
    2. Site performance ranking (completion %, dropout rates, protocol violations)
    3. RED FLAGS: SITE-007 has 14% dropout + 5 protocol violations + 2 SAEs + "Delayed" status
    4. Efficacy readiness (Phase IIb shows 8.9-12.1% LVEF improvement - meets Phase III threshold?)
    5. Safety concerns (7 SAEs total, 0.95% rate - acceptable for Phase III?)
    6. Recommendations for Phase III site selection and remediation needs
  expected_output: >
    Clinical Operations Assessment Report with:
    - Site performance scorecard (ranked 1-8)
    - SITE-007 remediation action plan
    - Phase III enrollment strategy (how to scale from 8 sites to 35 sites)
    - Patient safety readiness (SAE trends, monitoring requirements)
    - Go/No-Go recommendation for Phase III initiation

assess_regulatory_compliance_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate regulatory readiness for Phase III. Review:
    1. CMC status (75% complete - what's missing?)
    2. Regulatory timeline feasibility (EMA Q2 2028, FDA Q4 2028 targets)
    3. CRITICAL RISK: SITE-007 protocol violations (5 reported) - will this block EMA submission?
    4. Arrhythmia SAEs in elderly patients - does this require additional Phase III monitoring?
    5. GMP audit pending Q1 2026 - timeline impact?
    6. Required submissions: IND (FDA), CTA (EMA) - timing and dependencies
    7. Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway - what does FDA need?
  expected_output: >
    Regulatory Readiness Assessment with:
    - CMC gap analysis and closure timeline
    - Submission readiness checklist (IND/CTA requirements)
    - SITE-007 remediation impact on EMA submission timing
    - Risk mitigation plan for arrhythmia signal management
    - GMP audit preparation status
    - Revised regulatory timeline with confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
    - Go/No-Go recommendation with regulatory risks

evaluate_manufacturing_capacity_task:
  description: >
    Assess manufacturing readiness for Phase III and commercial supply. Analyze:
    1. Current capacity (50K tablets/month) vs Phase III needs (200K tablets/month = 4x expansion)
    2. Timeline feasibility (12 months available before Phase III launch Q2 2026)
    3. CRITICAL BOTTLENECK: API supplier single-source (Chemsynth AG) with 16-week lead time
    4. Packaging supplier (Huhtamaki) - 8-week lead time, only 3 months stock
    5. Expansion investment requirement ($8.5M) - capex approval status?
    6. GMP audit Q1 2026 - will expanded facility pass inspection?
    7. Safety stock strategy - what buffer is needed for Phase III continuity?
  expected_output: >
    Manufacturing Readiness Assessment with:
    - Production capacity roadmap (Q1 2026, Q2 2026, Q3 2026 milestones)
    - Supply chain risk matrix (API, packaging, other components)
    - Backup supplier qualification plan (Malaysia API supplier)
    - Capex approval timeline and contingency plans
    - GMP readiness checklist for expanded facility
    - Safety stock requirements and procurement schedule
    - Go/No-Go recommendation with manufacturing constraints on Phase III timing

develop_kol_strategy_task:
  description: >
    Create Phase III KOL engagement and market strategy. Analyze:
    1. Available KOLs (20 profiles in database, influence scores 77-98)
    2. Phase IIb investigators (6 current - are they Phase III ready?)
    3. "Not recommended" KOLs (4 marked FALSE - why exclude them?)
    4. Geographic coverage needed (Germany primary, UK/France/Spain secondary, APAC tertiary)
    5. Patient volume capacity (20 KOLs Ã— avg 900 patients = 18K potential vs 1,200 Phase III need)
    6. Influence score targeting (top 50 needed from 20 available - quality over quantity)
    7. Research interest alignment (personalize outreach to their specialties)
    8. Pricing strategy validation ($480/month - is it acceptable to KOLs?)
  expected_output: >
    Commercial Operations & KOL Strategy with:
    - Top 50 KOL recommendations (priority ranking 1-20, secondary tier, marginal tier)
    - Regional strategy (Germany 40%, EU 35%, APAC 25%)
    - Phase III recruitment capacity assessment
    - KOL outreach timeline and personalization strategy
    - Pricing acceptance risk assessment
    - Marketing materials prioritization (60% complete - what's critical first?)
    - Go/No-Go recommendation with commercial readiness level

synthesize_operational_readiness_task:
  description: >
    Synthesize all four operational assessments into a unified Phase III go/no-go decision.
    You have received reports from:
    1. Clinical Ops: Site readiness, enrollment strategy, safety assessment
    2. Regulatory Ops: CMC gaps, submission timeline, SITE-007 remediation impact
    3. Manufacturing Ops: Production scaling, supply chain risks, capex requirements
    4. Commercial Ops: KOL strategy, market readiness, pricing validation
    
    Your mission:
    - Identify CRITICAL PATH ITEMS (what blocks Phase III most urgently?)
    - Highlight interdependencies (e.g., manufacturing delays impact regulatory submission?)
    - Create integrated action plan with milestones
    - Assess overall Phase III readiness with confidence level
    - Make GO/NO-GO recommendation with conditions if needed
    - Prepare executive summary for C-suite decision (max 1 page)
